# drone-terraform

[Drone](https://github.com/drone/drone) CI/CD infrastructure using [Terraform][3] in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).

## Requirement

AWS Fargate with Amazon ECS is currently only available in the following regions:


|Region Name	|Region|
|-------------|------|
|US East (N. Virginia)	|us-east-1|
|US East (Ohio)	|us-east-2|
|US West (Oregon)	|us-west-2|
|EU West (Ireland)	|eu-west-1|
|Asia Pacific (Tokyo)	|ap-northeast-1|
|Asia Pacific (Singapore)	|ap-southeast-1|
|Asia Pacific (Sydney)	|ap-southeast-2|

See [AWS Fargate on Amazon ECS][1] to get more detail information. Service discovery is available in the following AWS Regions:

|Region Name	|Region|
|-------------|------|
|US East (N. Virginia)	|us-east-1|
|US East (Ohio)	|us-east-2|
|US West (N. California)	|us-west-1|
|US West (Oregon)	|us-west-2|
|EU West (Ireland)	|eu-west-1|

See [AWS Service Discovery][2] to get more detail information. So you can only create the drone infrastructure in `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, `us-west-2` or `eu-west-1` region using [Terraform][3]. Before you begin, make sure you've read the limition.

## Configuration

create new file with `terraform.tfvars` filename and put the following variable:

```
aws_access_key = "xxx"
aws_secret_key = "xxx"
drone_github_client = "xxxx"
drone_github_secret = "xxxx"
ssh_public_key = "ssh-rsa xxxxxx appleboy@xxxx"
```

## Build Infrastructure


The first command to run for a new configuration

```
$ terraform init
Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
- downloading plugin for provider "aws"...
```

Apply Changes

```
$ terraform apply
```

You will see the output:

```
Outputs:

alb_hostname = http://drone-front-alb-xxxxxxx.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
database_root_password = <sensitive>
region = us-east-1
```

## How to testing

```sh
$ go test -timeout 30m -v .
```
